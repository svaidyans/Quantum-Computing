## About Quantum Computing

</p>

We have all heard the buzz around Quantum Computers.  Today’s smartphones have the computing power of a military computer from 50 years ago that was the size of an entire room. However, even with the phenomenal strides we have made in technology and classical computers since the onset of the computer revolution, there remain problems that classical computers just can’t solve.  Even though a classical computer helps us do many amazing things, “under the hood” it’s really just a calculator that uses a sequence of bits—values of 0 and 1 to represent two states (think on and off switch) to makes sense of and decisions about the data we input following a prearranged set of instructions. 

When you enter the world of atomic and subatomic particles, things begin to behave in unexpected ways. In fact, these particles can exist in more than one state at a time. It’s this ability that Quantum Computers take advantage of.  Instead of bits, which conventional computers use, a Quantum Computer uses Quantum bits—known as Qubits. To illustrate the difference, imagine a sphere. A bit can be at either of the two poles of the sphere, but a Qubit can exist at any point on the sphere (called "Superposition"). So, this means that a computer using Qubits can store an enormous amount of information and uses less energy doing so than a classical computer. Another interesting aspect is called "Quantum Entanglement".  It is a physical phenomenon which occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the other(s), even when the particles are separated by a large distance—instead, a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole.  Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization, performed on entangled particles are found to be correlated.

By entering into this Quantum area of computing where the traditional laws of Physics no longer apply, we will be able to create Quantum Processors that are significantly faster (a million or more times) than the ones we use today. it will be game-changing for every industry and will have a huge impact in the way we do business, invent new medicine and materials, safeguard our data, explore space, and predict weather events and climate change. It’s no coincidence that some of the world’s most influential companies such as IBM and Google and the world’s governments are investing in Quantum Computing technology. They are expecting Quantum Computing to change our world because it will allow us to solve problems and experience efficiencies that aren’t possible today.

### Problem set classification

Quantum Computers are not intended to replace classical computers, they are expected to be a different tool we will use to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of a classical computer:

## Implementation of few Quantum algorithms
Before we start off examining few Quantum Algorithms, a brief about the state of Quantum Computers.  As mentioned before, several Fortune 50 companies including IBM, Microsoft, Google are all working on creating Quantum Computers.  IBM has created a public cloud platform called [IBM Quantum Experience or IBM QX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Q_Experience).  As of July 2018, this has five Quantum Processors (with three of them available to public) as well as a Quantum Simulator:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/IBM QX Devices.png" width="480" height="160"></img>
</p>

Users interact with a quantum processor through the Quantum Circuit model of computation, applying Quantum Gate on the Qubits using a GUI called the Quantum Composer, writing Quantum Assembly Language (QASM) code or through a high level programming level like Python accessing IBM QX via API by using [QISKit](https://developer.ibm.com/code/open/projects/qiskit/).

Similarly D-Wave Systems has opened up free access to its [D-Wave 2000Q quantum computer](https://www.dwavesys.com/d-wave-two-system).

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dwave.gif" width="240" height="160"></img>
</p>

Called "[Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/)", the cloud based Quantum Application Environment provides access to a live quantum computer along with a SDK called "[Ocean SDK](https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk)" for implementing algorithms with Python.

### Grover's Algorithm
We are now in a good place to discuss our first Quantum algorithm.

One of the many advantages a Quantum Computer has over a classical computer is its superior speed searching databases. Grover’s Algorithm (GA) demonstrates this capability. This algorithm can speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically, but its uses extend beyond that; it can serve as a general subroutine to obtain quadratic run time improvements for a variety of other algorithms. 

Suppose you are given a large <i>unsorted</i> list of "N" items. Among these items there is one item with a unique property that we wish to locate; we will call this one the winner "ω". Think of each item in the list as a box of a particular color. Say all items in the list are gray except the winner "ω", which is pink.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Grover-1.png" width="320" height="100"></img>
</p>

To find the pink box – the <i>marked item</i> – using classical computation, one would have to check on average N/2 of these boxes, and in the worst case, all "N" of them. On a Quantum Computer, however, we can find the marked item in roughly √N steps with Grover’s algorithm.  For ex., if N = (1 billion) items, then Grover's search would only require √(1 billion) ≈ 31623 checks!  A quadratic speedup is indeed a substantial time-saver for finding marked items in long lists. Additionally, the algorithm does not use the list’s internal structure, which makes it generic; this is why it immediately provides a quadratic Quantum speed-up for many classical problems.

Coming back to our unsorted database with "N" entries.  GA requires an N-dimensional state space H, which can be supplied by log2N qubits.

Let us number the database entries by 0, 1, ... (N-1). Choose an observable, Ω, acting on H, with N distinct eigenvalues whose values are all known. Each of the eigenstates of Ω encode one of the entries in the database, in a manner that we will describe. Denote the eigenstates (using bra-ket notation) as

{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ⋯, ∣N − 1⟩}

and the corresponding eigenvalues by

{λ0, λ1, ⋯, λN − 1}

We are provided with a unitary operator, Uω, which acts as a subroutine that compares database entries according to some search criterion. The algorithm does not specify how this subroutine works, but it must be a quantum subroutine that works with superpositions of states. Furthermore, it must act specially on one of the eigenstates, |ω>, which corresponds to the database entry matching the search criterion. To be precise, we require Uω to have the following effects:

Uω∣ω⟩ =  − ∣ω⟩

Uω∣x⟩ = ∣x⟩  for all x ≠ ω

Our goal is to identify this eigenstate |ω>, or equivalently the eigenvalue ω, that Uω acts specially upon.

The steps of GA are as follows:

1.  Initialize the system to the state <img src="images/Grover-2.png" width="150" height="50"></img>.

2.  Perform the following "Grover iteration" <i>r(N)</i> times. The function <i>r(N)</i> is described below:
    <br>a.  Apply the operator Uω
    <br>b.  Apply the operator Us = 2∣s⟩⟨s∣ − I.

3.  Perform the measurement Ω. The measurement result will be λω with probability approaching 1 for N>>1. From λω, ω may be obtained.

For those of you mathematically inclined, the original Grover's paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9605043.pdf).

#### Implementation
Let us try implementing GA with 3 qubits (8 combinations) and as ω as |111>.  To recall, GA is represented as:

### Shor's Algorithm
Although any integer number has a unique decomposition into a product of primes, finding the prime factors is believed to be a hard problem. In fact, the security of our online transactions rests on the assumption that factoring integers with a thousand or more digits is practically impossible. This assumption has been challenged in 1995 when Peter Shor proposed a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for the factoring problem. Shor’s algorithm is arguably the most dramatic example of how the paradigm of quantum computing changed our perception of which problems should be considered tractable. In this section we briefly summarize some basic facts about factoring, highlight main ingredients of the Shor’s algorithm, and illustrate how it works using a factoring problem.

Suppose our task is to factor an integer N with d decimal digits. The brute force algorithm goes through all primes P up to √N
and checks whether P divides N. In the worst case, this would take time roughly √N which is exponential in the number of digits d.  A more efficient algorithm known as the Quadratic Sieve attempts to construct integers (a, b) such that (a^2 − b^2) is a multiple of N. Once such (a, b) are found, one checks whether a±b have common factors with N.  The Quadratic Sieve method has asymptotic runtime exponential in √d. The most efficient classical factoring algorithm known as General Number Field Sieve achieves an asymptotic runtime exponential in ∛d.  The exponential runtime scaling limits applicability of the classical factoring algorithms to numbers with a few hundred digits  with the world record being d=232 (which took roughly 2,000 CPU years).  In contrast, Shor’s factoring algorithm has runtime polynomial in d.

The detailed explanation and steps of Shor's Algorithm can be found [here](https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2014/04/30/shors-algorithm-breaking-rsa-encryption/).

### Molecule Simulation
Chemical reactions are quantum in nature, because they form highly entangled quantum superposition states. While the energies of molecular hydrogen can be computed classically (albeit inefficiently), working out the energy of something like a propane (C3H8) molecule would take a classical supercomputer in the region of 10 days.

Molecular simulation has enormous potential in chemistry with benefits ranging from better solar cells to medicines.

With Micorosoft's Quantum Development Kit ([QDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit)) and a combination of Q# and C#, the energy levels at different bond lengths of a Hydrogen and Lithium Hydride molecule are simulated.  Estimates of the ground state energy which are a function of bond distance are computed using the quantum phase estimation algorithm, using Hamiltonian simulation by a Trotter-Suzuki integrator.  

The GitHub repository for Hydrogen and Lithium Hydrid simulations are availabe respectively [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/release/v0.3.1810/Samples/src/H2SimulationGUI), and [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/release/v0.3.1810/Chemistry/LithiumHydrideGUI).

### Finance Simulation
The [Monte Carlo method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgO1gpXSUzU) is a technique used to estimate a system’s properties stochastically, by statistically sampling realizations of the system. It is ubiquitous in science, with applications in physics, chemistry, engineering, and finance. Where it really shines is in dealing with extremely large or complex systems, which cannot be approached analytically or handled through other methods. In finance, the stochastic approach is typically used to simulate the effect of uncertainties affecting the financial object in question, which could be a stock, a portfolio, or an option. This makes Monte Carlo methods applicable to portfolio evaluation, personal finance planning, risk evaluation, and derivatives pricing.

The problem with Monte Carlo methods is that, if we want to obtain the most probable outcome of a wide distribution or obtain a result with a very small associated error, the required number of simulations can become gigantic. This is the case for stock market simulations, for instance, which are routinely day-long simulations. In this situation, obtaining a quantum speedup could make a notable difference.

An important ingredient toward a quantum accelerated Monte Carlo was recently suggested: Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithm. QAE can sample a probabilistic distribution quadratically faster than the next best classical method, allowing it to estimate expectation values extremely efficiently.

With IBM's QISKIT Finance option pricing framework, let us look at an Asian Barrier Spread option example.  An Asian barrier spread is a combination of 3 different option types:

* [Asian option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asianoption.asp): The payoff depends on the average price over the considered time horizon.
* [Barrier option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrieroption.asp): The payoff is zero if a certain threshold is exceeded at any time within the considered time horizon.
* [(Bull) Spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullspread.asp): The payoff follows a piecewise linear function (depending on the average price) starting at zero, increasing linear, staying constant.

The Jupyter Notebook of an implementation is [here](python/Asian_Barrier_Spreads.ipynb).

A simpler European Call option pricing example is [here](python/European_Call.ipynb).

#### Bernoulli distribution based Probability Mass Function

While classical computers use only pseudo-random routines, quantum computers can generate true random variates. For example, the measurement of a quantum superposition is intrinsically random, as suggested by Born's rule. Consequently, some of the best random-number generators are based on such quantum-mechanical effects. Further, with a logarithmic amount of random bits, quantum computers can produce linearly many more bits, which is known as randomness expansion protocols.

In practical applications, one wishes to use random variates of well-known distributions, rather than random bits. I have been able to implement a Probability Mass Function with Bernoulli distribution, by extending the work done by [IBM](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/bea399999cda8712caa207a7172854467f9011ad/qiskit/aqua/generating_random_variates.ipynb).

The Jupyter Notebook is available [here](assets/Bernoulli_Random_Number.ipynb).
